### sec_edgar_get_filings

**Description:** List SEC filings for a company with fiscal period labels.
Returns metadata for each filing: form type, report date, fiscal_year, fiscal_period,
filing date, and accession number.

## Primary use case: look up fiscal period labels before calling other tools
Each row includes fiscal_year and fiscal_period columns (e.g. fiscal_year=2024,
fiscal_period=Q2), so you can identify which filing corresponds to 'Q2 FY2024'
and pass the correct financial_parameter to sec_get_financial_statements.

Supports all form types: 10-K (annual), 10-Q (quarterly), 8-K, S-1, DEF 14A,
13F-HR, Form 4, etc.


**Required Parameters:**
- `ticker` (string): US stock ticker symbol
- `file_path` (string): Absolute path to save. CSV format.

**Optional Parameters:**
- `form_type` (string): SEC form type filter: '10-K', '10-Q', '8-K', '4', '13F-HR'. Omit for all types.
- `limit` (integer): Max filings to return. Default 20. (default: 20)

### sec_edgar_get_financial_statements

**Description:** Get full structured financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)
for a US-listed company, parsed directly from SEC filing XBRL packages.

## When to use this tool vs sec_get_xbrl_facts
- Use THIS tool when you need the COMPLETE statement structure: all line items,
  subtotals, segment breakdowns, and presentation hierarchy — as it appears in the
  actual SEC filing. Best for: detailed financial analysis, financial modeling,
  reproducing the full balance sheet or income statement.
- Use sec_get_xbrl_facts when you need a SINGLE METRIC across multiple years
  (e.g. revenue trend 2019–2024, net income history). xbrl_facts is faster for
  time-series of one concept.

## Multi-year coverage in one call
The latest 10-K already includes 3 fiscal years side by side (income statement,
cash flow) and 2 years (balance sheet). Do NOT call this tool multiple times to
get recent years — one call without financial_parameter returns the latest filing
with multi-year comparatives already included.

## Locating a specific filing
Use financial_parameter with fiscal period notation: 'FY2023' for annual,
'Q2FY2026' for quarterly. The tool resolves the correct filing automatically
regardless of the company's fiscal year end. If unsure which periods are available,
call sec_get_filings first to see the full list with fiscal labels.

## View levels
'summary' (~15 rows), 'standard' (~25 rows, default), 'detailed' (~50+ rows with
segment breakdowns).


**Required Parameters:**
- `ticker` (string): US stock ticker symbol (e.g. 'AAPL', 'MSFT')
- `statement` (string): 'income_statement', 'balance_sheet', 'cash_flow', or 'all'. Aliases: 'is', 'bs', 'cf'. (options: income_statement, balance_sheet, cash_flow, is, bs, cf, all)
- `file_path` (string): Absolute path to save. CSV format.

**Optional Parameters:**
- `financial_parameter` (string): Fiscal period to retrieve. Use fiscal notation (preferred):
  'FY{YYYY}'   — annual 10-K,  e.g. 'FY2023'
  'Q{N}FY{YYYY}' — quarterly 10-Q, e.g. 'Q2FY2026', 'Q1FY2024'
The tool maps the fiscal label to the correct filing automatically,
regardless of the company's fiscal year end (e.g. AAPL ends in September,
so FY2023 maps to the filing with period_of_report=2023-09-30).
Raw report date in YYYYMMDD format is also accepted as fallback.
If omitted, returns the latest available filing (which already includes
2–3 years of comparative data).

- `view` (string): Detail level: 'summary' (~15 rows), 'standard' (default ~25 rows), 'detailed' (~50+ rows with segment breakdowns). (default: standard) (options: summary, standard, detailed)
- `report_type` (string): 'annual' (10-K, default) or 'quarterly' (10-Q). Ignored when financial_parameter
is provided in fiscal notation (e.g. 'Q2FY2026' already implies quarterly).
 (default: annual) (options: annual, quarterly)

### sec_edgar_get_xbrl_facts

**Description:** Get structured XBRL financial facts for a company across time.

## When to use this tool vs sec_get_financial_statements
- Use THIS tool when you need a SINGLE METRIC over multiple years (e.g. revenue
  trend 2019–2024, net income history, 5-year capex). Returns a flat time-series
  DataFrame — fast, one request covers all years.
- Use sec_get_financial_statements when you need the COMPLETE statement structure
  (all line items, subtotals, hierarchy) for a specific filing period.

## Three query modes (mutually exclusive — provide exactly one):
1. keyword (recommended for most queries): map a plain-language term to standard
   XBRL concepts via a predefined table. Near-synonyms accepted.
   Example: keyword='salary' → fetches LaborAndRelatedExpense, SalariesAndWages, etc.
2. concept: exact XBRL concept name for precise time-series lookup.
   Use when you know the exact us-gaap tag. Note: companies switch concepts over
   time (e.g. AAPL moved from 'Revenues' to
   'RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax' after FY2018).
   When unsure, prefer keyword mode.
3. metric: convenience shortcut returning the single latest annual + quarterly
   value. No year/period filtering needed.

## Filtering
Use 'year' to restrict results (e.g. '2019-2023'). Filtering is based on the
period end date of each data point, not the fiscal year of the filing.


**Required Parameters:**
- `ticker` (string): US stock ticker symbol
- `file_path` (string): Absolute path to save. CSV format.

**Optional Parameters:**
- `concept` (string): Exact XBRL concept name (e.g. 'NetIncomeLoss', 'Assets'). Returns a time series
for that concept. Prefer keyword mode if you are not certain of the exact concept
name — wrong concepts return empty results silently.

- `keyword` (string): Predefined keyword to search XBRL concepts. Supported keywords: revenue, revenues, sales, netsales, netincome, income, profit, grossprofit, operatingincome, ebit, assets, totalassets, currentassets, noncurrentassets, liabilities, totalliabilities, currentliabilities, noncurrentliabilities, equity, stockholdersequity, cash, cashandequivalents, operatingcashflow, freecashflow, debt, longtermdebt, shorttermdebt, borrowings, salary, salaries, compensation, labor, employee, payroll, wage, wages, sharebasedcompensation, stockbasedcompensation, cost, cogs, costofrevenue, costofgoodssold, operatingexpense, operatingexpenses, capex, capitalexpenditure, capitalexpenditures, depreciation, amortization, depreciationandamortization, inventory, receivables, accountsreceivable, payables, accountspayable, goodwill, intangibles, intangibleassets, ppe, propertyplantequipment, marketablesecurities, investments, eps, earningspershare, basiceps, dilutedeps, shares, sharesoutstanding, dividends, tax, incometax, interest, interestexpense, rd, research, researchanddevelopment, randd. Near-synonyms are accepted (e.g. 'wages' matches salary concepts).

- `metric` (string): Quick metric name for a single latest value: returns most recent annual + quarterly. No year filter needed. Options: 'revenue', 'net_income', 'total_assets', 'operating_income', 'free_cash_flow', 'stockholders_equity', 'operating_cash_flow', 'total_liabilities', 'current_assets', 'current_liabilities', 'capital_expenditures'. (options: revenue, net_income, total_assets, operating_income, free_cash_flow, stockholders_equity, operating_cash_flow, total_liabilities, current_assets, current_liabilities, capital_expenditures)
- `year` (string): Filter by period end year. Single: '2023'. Range: '2019-2023'. Filtering uses the data point's period end date, not the filing's fiscal year. Strongly recommended to avoid oversized results.
- `period` (string): Filter by fiscal period: 'FY' (annual), 'Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'. (options: FY, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
