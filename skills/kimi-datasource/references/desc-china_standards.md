## Available APIs

### china_standards_search

**Description:** Search one official Chinese standards platform by standard number or name. Choose gb, hb, db, or tt explicitly; exact mode normalizes and reranks standard numbers. Each result carries a provider_id field — pass its value as the standard_id parameter of china_standards_detail or china_standards_fetch. Result status is normalized to 现行 (current), 即将实施 (upcoming), 废止 (abolished), or 未知 (unknown); when the provider page lacks explicit status text the status is date-inferred and status_conflict is true.

**Required Parameters:**
- `standard_type` (string): Official standards platform: gb national, hb industry, db local, or tt association standards. (options: gb, hb, db, tt)
- `query` (string): Standard number or name keyword.

**Optional Parameters:**
- `match_mode` (string): keyword keeps provider ordering; exact filters and reranks normalized standard numbers. (default: keyword) (options: keyword, exact)
- `page` (integer): One-based provider page number. (default: 1)
- `page_size` (integer): Requested provider page size. TT is additionally subject to its current 100-record search cap. (default: 10)
